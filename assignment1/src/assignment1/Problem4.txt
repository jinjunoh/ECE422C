I expect to learn the basics of Java and OOP. I am also excited to learn more about Machine Learning and the
opportunity to use Andriod Studio to create a mobile application. If we have time at the end of the semester,
I would also like to learn real life skills that a software engineer would use such as system architecture/design,
 database management, and software testing.
